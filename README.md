# SWAT - Fly Swatting game
SWAT is a fun little game where you have to swat all the flys on the screen within a set time limit. If you are able to swat all of the flys, you will then move onto the next level. Each level will have one extra fly but the same time limit, so having to swat more and more as your progress through.
